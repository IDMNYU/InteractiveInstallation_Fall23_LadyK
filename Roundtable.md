### Deliverables for the Roundtable Discussions 

Roundtable discussions will take place a week after the project briefs are released. After developing your ideas (ie, Scamper Technique](S-C-A-M-P-E-R.md),[Card Sorting Technique](cardSortingTechnique.md) ), write a concise paragraph as to what your idea is about. Then, with a bit of research and sketching, we will discuss these ideas in class as a group discussion. It’s an opportunity to bounce ideas off the group in order to get good feedback. This ensures a strong project that meets the minimum project requirements while investigating your conceptual interests.

In order to prepare for this presentation and to communicate your ideas to the class succinctly, the following is required as a Process Site post under the particular project tab. At times, you may be asked to document your presentation of these ideas and to post the video to your Process Site, under the particular Project tab.

You must have 3 separate/different ideas for EACH roundtable. For each idea present the following:

<ul>
<li>Describe the concept in 3 brief sentences</li> 
<li>Visually show links to at least 3 other similar works or influences – both technical and conceptual. Minimum 6 links. </li>
<li><a href ="storyboardTemplates">Use the storyboard template provided</a> to describe what the experience is like over time. What does it look like initially? What is the space like? How would I interact with it? How would it react to me? What would that reaction look like? Show the timeline of interactivity: when no one is around, when one person is around, when a group of people are around, when it turns on, when it turns off, how it turns on and off, etc, etc.</li>
<li>What space would this use on campus?</li>
<li>What is the interface? What is controlling this system?</li>
<li> What are the inputs? Describe these in detail, with visual sketches or examples.</li>
<li> What are the outputs? Describe these in detail, with visual sketches or examples.</li>
<li> What other projects, pieces, issues, problems, phenomena are inspiring or influencing your project? Are there related projects/pieces out there already? What are they? Give context to your idea, outside of your own head. </li> 
<li> What media will you be using or creating? </li>
</ul>

After generating the above material, you must also then prepare a 4 minute (total) presentation of your ideas to give to the class. Upload the presentation material to your process site. You do not have to present from your Process site. Rather, the documents from the presentation must be documented on your process site.

After the creation of your presentation, you must then _practice giving the entire presentation, including all media._ This is key. You must practice talking about your concepts, as well as loading media. It shows when you haven't practiced and you will be cut off after 4 minutes.

• Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools - ie, notes)
Get familiar with your display preferences in advance!! I'm not kidding either. Borrow a cable from the student aids outside the MAGNET Floor Manager's office by the kitchen area, and try it out on your own BEFORE class. Seriously! It makes all the difference in the quality of your presentation and presentation nerves.

• If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to Crestron. Test this out on the projector before your present. See above.

• Do not present to me. Look at your audience, your classmates. You are presenting to them.
