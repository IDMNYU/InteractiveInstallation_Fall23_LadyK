### Final Critique Dec 11th 

The final project is of your choosing. It must have a conceptual componenet, that is evident in your research. The impact of that research should be evident in your input, output, code or all 3. You must create and design the control system, as well as the media, inputs and outputs.

You must create an experience, that changes over time. Another way to look at it, is an experience that unfolds or one with different modes or behaviors. As a result, in addition to triggering output, it's also managing time and spawning events. As a result, this is a more sophisticated system with behaviors.

You must decide whether the interaction is direct, or in-direct. You should be able to talk about the input and how you went about it, as well as how that method supports your concept. 

I expect you to dig deeper than that and to use this system to illustrate a concept. I am looking for a portfolio level piece here.

Check out some different techniques such as the SCAMPER Technique or the Card Sorting to help your brainstorm ideas and to develop them further. Show evidence of these techniques in use on your blog through visual evidence and reflection.

* [Scamper Technique](S-C-A-M-P-E-R.md)

* [Card Sorting Technique](cardSortingTechnique.md)

Your piece should use some form of networking - other computers, other applications + technologies - as well as some best pratices for maintence and upkeep. Your project must be stable enough to run without errors or stalling for a few hours.

If you are struggling with a concept, I suggest that you review the readings assigned this semester and the Show & Tell People. Experiment with the demos given, review the ideation techniques, and demonstrate evidence of your processes. I am *not* looking for utilization of all the techiques we've been looking at. I am expecting you to thoroughly investigate of a few of these techniques, by utlizing them, with an articulated concept that is driving the process of creation. (Don't be a zombie, who is racing to the finish line. The process of making should inform you. While you may have set-backs, those set-backs should not curtail your making. They should be informing you on how you need to move forward, and your process will demonstrate this through physical evidence.) Use some techniques that interest you whether that is physically or conceptually; whether it is with regard to input and output. Sketches and simple ideas are great building blocks to your project. You could even begin by remaking a project that was created by one of the people we reviewed in class. Then dig deeper, tweak, experiment, expand. Remix. Play. Start with this. Just don't end here.


When building a technical interactive system, treat each element of your system as a distinct aspect. Get each one technically working and working independently. Then, bring the various elements together to work. Thread them together slowly.


### Deliverables for Nov 5th
• A post on your Process Site under "Final Project" with the following:

• Concept map/Word map of concepts and ideas that you are interested in exploring

• Show evidence of your cardsorting exercise or scamper exercise output. Include a reflection which summarizes your endpoints.

• 3-7 different artists, designers, projects, theorists, writers, musicans, poets

• Use the [storyboard templates](storyboardTemplates) to sketch out what would happen over time in your piece. What changes? What causes those changes? What does the space look like? What do those changes look like?

• How would I interact with it? How would it react to me? What would that reaction look like? Show the timeline of interactivity: when no one is around, when one person is around, when a group of people are around, when it turns on, when it turns off, how it turns on and off, etc, etc.

• What is the system design? What is talking to what?

• What are the inputs and outputs to the piece?

• What spaces are you thinking of using?

• What will the media be in your piece? Collect it now!

• Initial pieces of code. (Remember to break things down into steps)
