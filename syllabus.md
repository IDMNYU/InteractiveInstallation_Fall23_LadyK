What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hand-on course, students will learn how to create interactive installations and environments. Scale and space will be explored with reference to the body, while creating cybernetic systems for real-time and time-based interaction. Software (Max/MSP/Jitter, Computer Vision, Arduino), electronics and physical computing will be covered in a workshop style format, with the goal of students creating physically interactive environments and systems. A variety of input and output mechanisms (edge detection, tracking, capacitance sensors, presence sensors, custom switches, etc), networking and best practices will be covered in workshops. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive art and design, space, time and installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas/concepts through the lense of this course or to work with given design briefs. 

### Program Goals

This course reinforces the IDM Program goals by

• Integrate multiple mediums of image, text, sound, physical, space, and interactivity. (Reinforced)

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition. 

• Combine research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration. (Reinforced)

• Collaborate across disciplines.

• Adopt and use professional practices. (Reinforced)

• Integrate Cultural Literacy

• Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. Skills acquisition.

### Objectives

Students will gain a vocabulary for interactivity and learn a variety of tools and techniques to create interactive installations, including tracking, edge detection, sensors, basic electronics and physical computing. Students will gain knowledge of different methods to create interactive installations including: installations for 1 person, many people, time dependent or input dependent. Students will understand the difference between reactive, interactive and dynamically changing systems. 

Students are expected to bring ideas to explore with these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful function of the technical process. The goal is to integrate these technical elements as a tool to express larger ideas and abstract concepts. This could be a problem, phenomena, story, natural element, or other form of expression. This class is about exploring those on a physical scale beyond a simple object and within the element of time. Projects will create full scale and dynamic installations using both digital and physical means. The final project will be portfolio-level quality works.

### Pre-requisites

This class assumes a high degree of computer literacy, but not a super high degree of programming ability. I don't expect you to be familiar with techniques and how to execute them technically. We'll cover those in the workshop. But I do expect you to be able to pick up the different programming and technical environments and to demonstrate research, problem solving, resourcefulness, investigation and experimentation. I do expect you to explore these tools independently and to be making personal discoveries with them. I do expect you to review the items, explore new ones, and to build patches utilizing them, while building your own vocabulary. _You must practice the material. You must play with the material and explore it. Finally, you must experiment with it._

Students are welcome to incorporate other programming they are familiar with for the Projects, but not the puzzles. In order to do this successfully, you must have a master adeptness with other programming lanuages, including incorporating using openCV. If you do not have this competency on the first day of the course, you must complete the projects and exercises in Max. 

Later on in the semeseter, I will cover applications which can join various applications and programming platforms together through networking. So, if there is part of the project you'd like to accomplish in another langauge, that's fine, contingent upon you understanding the fundamentals of Max.

### Grading

Grades will be attributed to work based on your understanding and comprehension of the course materials & principles (both from the texts, lectures and workshops), creativity and craft. (Craft refers to the care you've taken to create the work. Is it thought out, considered, and sound? Or is it thrown together and hapazard?). You will be pushed to explore various concepts. All of these will be evident in your projects and participation throughout class.

You final grade will be determined by the following:

• Process Site + Participation (discussions, readings, roundtable feedback, challenges, critiques, self-assessments): 25%

• Show & Tell presentations: 5% 

• Max/MSP/Jitter Puzzles: 15%

• Project 1: Midterm: Interactive Installation 20% 

• Final Project: 35% (10% Working Prototype, 25% Final)

The Max puzzles build your understanding of Max, along with key pieces to build and control media. As a result, successful completion of the puzzles is critical for your midterm and final projects. As a result, each puzzle must be completed. 
Once you have solved the puzzle, I look for you to play, explore and experiment with other Max objects, tweaks, additions and refinements. Being in this stage, is what will move your grade beyond an average grade to an above average grade, and beyond.
Feedback is given to help you explore areas of your understanding where it is weak. Ideas are also suggested, in order to feed your projects and to have them grow. A project that has incorporated the process of ideation, iteration, and successful prototyping is one that also begins to prove it's self as being beyond average.

Simply completing the assignment will not generate you an "A". I am looking for you to grow, expand your understanding, experiment, and to take risks.

Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative and qualitative rubrics, as outlined below.

#### special notice to graduate students: You must obtain a grade "C" to pass the course. If you have a "C-" or below around midterms and there after, you will be advised to drop the course _before the last day to drop the course of the semester._ 


**A.	100 – 90%**	Excellent, Outstanding, Superior Performance, participation, attendance of the student has been of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, and pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands interactivity, has a developed and practically can create well-designed interactive installations.


**B.	89 – 80%**	Very Good / Good
Performance, participation, and attendance of student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average understanding of interactivity, yet not superior.


**C.	79 – 70%**	Satisfactory, OK, not bad
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of interactivity. Makes an avid attempt during the workshop and completes most of the workshops. Asks some questions in class, but a greater effort can be made to understand and apply the material. More time is needed to study, make, take risks and explore. 


**D.	69 – 63%**	Poor; Below Average
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many areas that show any understanding of interactivity. Minimal effort is being made on the students’ part. Problems include lack of interest, procrastination, and/or poor time management.


**F.	Below 62%**	Unacceptable
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest. Work submissions are missing, either in parts or completely missing.


### Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Class is a community. There is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential. Unexcused absences (without a note from a doctor or agency) will affect your grade. 

Material missed is the responsibility of the student to make up. Consult the syllabus. Consult Github. Consult Slack for the demo code. Speak to other classmates in order to find out what was lectured and discussed. Review the texts and resources. It is your responsibility to go over that material independently. Do these things first. It is your responsibility to contact me if you continue to have difficulty with the information.

•	Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness. If you are not here on critique day, your work needs to be as well as being posted to your Process site. Critiques cannot be made up.

•	Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (Slack Direct message is preferred)

•	Unexcused absences will affect your grade. Students are responsible for the content they missed.

•	One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5 pts out of 100 for each additional absence.

• If you have some extenuating need to be outside of class (special doctor's appointment, religious observations, medical issues, etc etc), please contact Deanna Rayment at (deanna.rayment@nyu.edu, 646.997.3046). They are the Coordinator of Student Advocacy and Compliance. They are there to support you. They will communicate with me, as to whether or not your absence is excused. Otherwise, assignments will be counted as late. Regardless of whether or not your absence is excused, you are responsible for the content you've missed. Extensions may be granted for excused absenses.

• 5 unexcused absences is grounds for dismissal from the course.  

• NYU’s Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays states that members of any religious group may, without penalty, absent themselves from classes when required in compliance with their religious obligations. You must notify me in advance of religious holidays or observances that might coincide with exams, assignments, or class times to schedule mutually acceptable alternatives. Students may also contact religiousaccommodations@nyu.edu for assistance."

• Zoom links and recordings are only available with a documented notice/excused absence. They are granted on a case-by-case basis. Brightspace will not be used for Zoom materials. 


### Participation

It’s imperative for you to be active in class – in discussion, research, and activity inside and outside of class. We are a community and you are a key component, regardless of whether you may be struggling or not.

### Communication

• Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many, etc) ONLY

• Talk to me in person about issues or problems

• Consult the [Slack](http://interactivein-2rp5602.slack.com) for the class at twice a week for up to date information and demo code

• Submit the weekly Tickets to Leave

• Be professional at all times in your communication and attitude

### Late Work

Work in this course is cumulative. This means that you need the knowledge learning in the previous assignment, to complete the next assignment. The concepts build upon themselves and are used throughout the semester. 

An assignment (ie, Puzzles & Projects) will be listed on the assignment brief. Challenges are due the day they are assigned and to be submitted during class. Period.

Work that is turned in after class but still on the due date get's 1/3 letter grade deduction. Work that is turned in the same week, get's 2/3 grade deduction. Subsequent submissions get one letter grade deduction for every week that it is late, beyond the first week. The lowest possible grade a late assignment will be given, will be an "F". Deductions are calculated AFTER the initial grade is given.

Regardless, it's MUCH better to turn something in, than to not turn in anything at all. Trust me.

If work is turned in beyond 4 weeks, the work must still meet the requirements for the assignment, or be an attempt in that direction. Work submitted beyond 4 weeks that does not make an attempt to meet the requirements will not be considered and a zero will be given for that assignment.

Assignments that are not submitted will receive a "0". Please realize that a "0" mark is a fantastic way to tank your grade. Getting an F is far better than getting a zero.

If you know in advance your work is going to be late, come talk to me. It can help massively.



### Process Site & GitHub

Creating anything involves a series of steps. Often, we think of these steps as a straight line. Many times we (think we) can go on auto-pilot after the first few step and coast to the finish. This is not the case when working with these mediums. You will constantly be confronted with challenges. In the process of resolving those challenges you'll be faced with opportunites to grow, expand and discover along side paths. These side paths are what enrich your projects to be engaging and meanful.

Work in this class moves beyond the simple, "get it working" to "how can we tweak this and make it better". You must move through and work out technical challenges to get to this point.

Reviewing our process through documentation, allows us to reflect and to gather thoughts as to what our next step should be in our process. Research gives us new insight. Drawing and sketching helps articulate our thoughts. We can translate these ideas to interactive systems using code and various forms of media.

You must have of evidence and collection of your ideas, research, and process (including steps and action). This is imperative. You must be organized and be able to show the development of your ideas and concepts. Also, you’ll need to be taking notes and images during workshops and demos. 

Your [Process Site](Process_Site.md) is where all of this information goes, along with reflections, context and dialogue. If you're Process site is thin, your work is thin and needs more energy put into your process.

Your Process site must have good, clear, good resolution documentation. Images and links of what inspires you. Links to media. Sketches, Drawings. System diagrams. Code, prototypes, installations, interfaces, user experience. Everything should be making an appearance on your Process Site. It must all be visually evident.

Github is where your code lives. A link to your Github must appear on your [Process Site](Process_Site.md).


### Required Readings

We will be reading from other artists, designers, critics and engineers throughout the semester: Margaret Morse, Myron Krueger, Golan Levin, Roy Ascott, Jack Burnham, Francis Halsall, Ken Rinaldo, Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau, Gordan Pask, Sofe Dinkla, among others.

Readings can either be found online with links in the calendar under homework, or supplied through the Slack Resources Channel for this class. Many are found in the text [*Systems* edited by Edward Shanken](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/systems).


### How to Submit Assignments via GitHub

To do this, you will be utilizing 3 apps: a browser, github desktop and a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, Terminal, etc) to complete this entire process.


Do the follow these steps to setup each assignment on Github:

	* 0. Save your work AND all of the necessary support files (index.html, libraries folder, pictures, media, etc) in a folder that is titled in this manner on your computer:
					*YourFirstNameYourLastName_AssignmentTitle*, etc.
	* 1. Go to your Github Repository page in a browser and create a new repo for the assignment, naming it InteractiveInstallation_Project_1

	* 2. Clone that repo to your desktop (it should launch the Github desktop app). Save that folder within a folder on your computer for this class.

	* 3. Using a file browser (Windows Explorer, Finder, etc), take the folder created in step 0 and drop it INSIDE the folder you just created by cloning in step 2.

	* 4. Go back to the GitHub Desktop app. In the summary field, write what additions you have made to your code in summary. In the description, add greater details, notes, and questions for me.

	* 5. Hit the "sync button" in the upper right hand corner. This uploads your code to your repo page on the Github website.

	* 6. Refresh your browser page of your repo. You should now see your code and files up on your repo

	* 7. As you continue to work on this project, save the code on your desktop, in the folder created in step 0, and have sinced moved to be within the folder created at step 2. After saving each work session's progress, re-visit the Github desktop app to push the changes to your Github repo online. Make sure to fill out the summary and description notes. Do NOT and I repeat, DO NOT, make a new folder within this folder with the weeks editions. IE, you should not have "Week 1 work", "week 2 work", etc. Github tracks your changes and keeps them in history. It's version control! Yay!


### TECHNOLOGY USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Laptop computers and other mobile devices are invaluable tools for artists, designers, and students when used responsibly. However, this technology can also be incredibly distracting, especially in the classroom. The experience is better for everyone in the class, if everyone can be present and active. It not only helps you, but it helps your neighbor. Again, we live in a community and we must think beyond our own needs.

[Read Clay Shirky's thoughts on students & laptops in the classroom.](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.ong79i9mw)

When in class, you may use your laptops and other devices for any activities pertaining to the course: taking notes, researching material relevant to our readings and discussions, doing homework, making class presentations, etc. However, the following uses are unacceptable: checking email, instant messaging, texting, using social networking sites such as facebook, etc. Also, during class screenings, your laptops should not be used.

Be forewarned, that if you are chronically in your devices and not participating in conversation, you will be called upon. Class is a community.


### Educational Accessibility Statement

NYU-Tandon is committed to assuring equal educational opportunity and full participation for all students.  The mission of the Office for Students with Disabilities is to provide individuals with learning differences (a.ka. disabilities) the same access to programs and activities as other students.  We assist students to maximize their potential while helping them develop and maintain independence.

Students who believe they are eligible for course accommodations under the ADA or Section 504 or have had accommodations please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu.  You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations.  Information about the Moses Center can be found at http://www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor. 

Faculty can provide course accommodations/modifications only after receipt of an approved accommodations letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Accommodation letters can be provided to qualified students at any time during the semester, but grades earned before the faculty receives the letter cannot be changed.

## Academic Integrity

Violations of academic integrity are considered to be acts of academic dishonesty and include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarizing, fabrication, denying other access to information or material, and facilitating academic dishonesty, and are subject to the policies and procedures noted in the Student Handbook and within the Course Catalog, including the Student Code of Conduct and the Student Judicial System.  Please note that lack of knowledge of citations procedures, for example, is an unacceptable explanation for plagiarism, as is having studied together to produce remarkable similar papers or creative works submitted separately by two students, or recycling work from a previous class.

Please review <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html">NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy</a> in its entirety.  Procedures may include, but are not limited to: failing the assignment, failing the course, going in front of an academic judicial council and possible suspension from school.  Violations will not be tolerated.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. In fact, a D is the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual style for citing and documenting source material.

This includes copying code for other sources, using code from other sources with only slight modifications and using code from other sources without a reference.

## Inclusion

The NYU Tandon School values an inclusive and equitable environment for all our students. I hope to foster a sense of community in this class and consider it a place where individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious, castes and political affiliations, and abilities will be treated with respect.   It is my intent that all students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.  If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.
