## S-C-A-M-P-E-R
### SCAMPER is an acronym. It stands for:

* Substitute

* Combine

* Adapt

* Modify

* Put To Another Use

* Eliminate

* Rearrange or Reverse 


This technique equips you with questions to brainstorm new ideas. When brainstorming, try asking yourself one or more question from each of these categories.

#### Substitute

* Can I replace or change any parts?

* Can I replace someone involved?

* Can the rules be changed?

* Can I use other ingredients or materials?

* Can I use other processes or procedures?

* What if I change its name?

* Can I substitute one part for another?


#### Combine

* What would happen if I combined this with something else in order to create something new?

* What ideas or parts can be combined?

* Can I combine or recombine its parts’ purposes?

* Can I combine or merge it with other objects?

* What materials could be combined?


#### Adapt

* Can I change my feelings or attitude towards it?

* Does the past offer any lessons with similar ideas?

* What other ideas does it suggest?

* What could I copy, borrow or steal?

* Whom could I emulate?

* What ideas could I incorporate?

* What processes can be adapted?

#### Modify

* Can I change its shape, look, or feel?

* Can I change its color, roughness, sound or smell?

* What can I add to modify this?

* What can I emphasize or highlight to create something different?

* What element of this can I strengthen to create something new?

Some references state that the M in SCAMPER represents magnify instead of modify. If you prefer this model, consider these questions instead:

* What can be magnified or made larger?

* What can be exaggerated or overstated?

* What can be made higher, bigger or stronger?

* Can I increase its frequency?

* What can be duplicated?

* Can I make multiple copies?

* Can I add extra features or somehow add extra value?

#### Put To Another Use

* Can I use this somewhere else, perhaps in another industry?

* How would this behave differently in another setting?

* Could you recycle the waste from this to make something new?

* What else can it be used for?

* Who else could use this?

* Can it be used by people other than those it was originally intended for?

* How would a child use it? An older person?

* How would people who are differently abled use it?

* Are there new ways to use it in its current shape or form?

* If I knew nothing about it, would I figure out the purpose of this idea?


#### Eliminate

* How can I streamline or simplify this?

* What’s non-essential or unnecessary?

* Can the rules be eliminated?

* What features or parts can I understate, tone down, or eliminate?

* Should I split it into different parts?

* What if I made it smaller, more compact, faster, lighter, or more fun?


#### Rearrange or Reverse

* What would happen if I reversed this process or sequenced things differently?

* What other arrangement might be better?

* What if I try to do the exact opposite of what I’m trying to do now?

* What roles could I reverse or swap?

* Can I interchange components?

* Are there other patterns, layouts or sequences I can use?

* Can I transpose cause and effect?

* Can I change pace or change the schedule of delivery?

* Can I transpose positives and negatives?

* How can I reorganize this?

* Should I turn it around? Up instead of down? Down instead of up?

* What if I consider it backwards?

* What if I try doing the exact opposite of what I originally intended?
