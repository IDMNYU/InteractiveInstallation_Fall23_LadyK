### Show & Tell

In the first week, you will either volunteer or be assigned to 2 people from the list below. On the assigned date, bring in 2-3 examples each person/group’s of their work, focusing on interactive installations/environments/pieces. Each date has at least 2 people/groups. Be familiar with a brief bio and be prepared to critically discuss/analyze the assigned individual and their supporting work in a dynamic presentation in front of the class. Do not be lame. Be informed.

In addition to Googling the people/projects, I encourage you to check out Eyeo’s website and Vimeo page, as well as Creative Applications site. 
Create a visual presentation (keynote, powerpoint, google slides, browser tabs, etc). You must show us their work. Do not just tell us about it. Show it to us and give us a context. Was the work a collaboration? Who else was part of the project? Was it a comission or design project?
Prepare the presentation to be 10-15 minutes TOTAL. After your presentation, upload your presentation after exporting it as a PDF. Upload the presentation PDF, titled with the Artist/Designer names, to slack resources

###### Deliverables
<ul>
<li>	10 minute presentation of the all of the Artists/Designers allocated for that numeral. Must be prepared, researched and practiced. </li>
<li>	Submit your presentation as a PDF to your Process Site with the Artists/Designers names as the title with the roman numeral. </li>
</ul>
